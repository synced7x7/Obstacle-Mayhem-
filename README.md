Its our first project (really special). We dived deep into SDL and to be able to complete the project with the C language was really impressive.
The main problem was the lack of resources. We needed to learn it for ourselves. We were unorganized but I think its okay for the first project.

#About the game
The game is divided into four stages. 
The first three stages represent classic 2d platform game. We took Super Mario as our inspiration.
But we were not satisfied with the result as it was really easy for us. So we implemented the concept of 2d fighting game. It was a rigorous jump but we were okay with it.
It was really tough for us but we made it through.
We were able to implement AI which was a great feat by itself. The visuals were also great. 
The player and the enemy contained multiple basic moveset but we weren't able to implement special moves for the time being and also the hitbox mechanism we implemented was not good.
We were able to give special forms for our players in the last stage and also implement rain in the game. 
Another problem was that the camera was fixed.

But either way we completed a great feat here specially with AI considering it was our first project and hope to keep improving as we move further.
